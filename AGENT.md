use scratch_pad file inside a local folder named '.local/[agent_name]_scratch_pad.md' where you will write in your mistakes and/or wrong assumptions and how you fix them. If 'local/[agent_name]_scratch_pad.md' doesn't exist creat it and make sure the ".local" folder in gitignore

When there is a major feature addition, architecture change, or design decision update, also update the root `proj-lifetime` file so the long-term project context stays current.
